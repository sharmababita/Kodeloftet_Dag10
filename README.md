# Kodeloftet_Dag10


Task description:
Today's task is to create an article-style website, where the focus is on how text and images can be used to convey a clear and engaging message. The task is about structuring the page so that the content guides the user through the main theme, while at the same time creating a visually coherent and user-friendly experience.

Claim:
Plan the page either using a list or a Figma wireframe
Use semantic HTML
Use the placement method flex in CSS
Choose at least one image and use appropriate headings and paragraphs to support the page's "hero" as the main message.
Choose at least two other sub-messages that can be categorized under the main message of the page. (Example: Bergen as main, Fløyen and Ulrikken as below.)
Use at least two different fonts, one for headings and another for text.
Bonus:
Create a full design of the website in Figma
Use the grid placement method in CSS to explore another way of placing content.
Check out the: hover pseudo element to see what you can do in terms of giving page content extra interactivity.
Check out the pseudo elements: linked and: active to see what you can do in frohold to make text in anchors turn blue.
If using open-license images, add a small text below the image showing credit to the photographer or source as part of the page design. (Example: The photo of the runway taken by Julie Hauge, 2019)
